                <h2><span>Goal Alignment</span></h2>
                <p>This Website was designed with a future employer as the user in mind. I wanted the Max Kruger Website to be easily traversable and display everything 
                    that a future employer may need or want to know about me. Basically, I wanted to make an employers work as easy as possible.
                    As an employer they would want to know exactly who I am, what type of person I am, my goals, my achivements, and my interests. <br/><br/>In my portfolio section, you can find out most things about me, my interest in Game Development, other hobbies, my strengths, weaknesses. Anything concerning me as a person is found there and is the most important for an employer. <br/>This website itself portrays my skills in front-end development.
                    But if you want to know more about the creation of this website and my learning experience in HTML and CSS then check out the Blog Section!

                <h2><span>Explanation of Interaction Points</span></h2>
                <p>The main interface element in my website is an a tag that is used to traverse between different pages. These tags look like buttons with a rounded border.
                    These tags are extremely readible and contrast the background colours. I also have a search bar for if users are searching for something specific and they do not wish to navigate through menus. These are both navigational components. 
                    Lastly I am using a drop down menu as a way for employers to contact me personally or to find my social network accounts. This is a Input Control.
                </p>

                
                

                    <h2><span>Style Process Documentation</span></h2>
                    <p>ii. The visual aesthetic of my website is minimalistic and modern. The negative space in my website helps create the minimilistic feeling. The clean and round interface elements used for headings and buttons help ther website feel more modern.
                        My colour scheme is also very modern using bright colours that contrast well with each other.
                        The curved edges of all of the elements gives off a more calming and modern feel to them.
                        Overall, the website has a sleek and contemporary style that represents my interests of gaming and technology well and in a appealing way.
                    </p>

                   <p>iii. The font I have used further reinforces the modern look to my website and it is comfortable on the eyes. Previously, I was lacking readability, as I had a very bold font. So I decided to change my paragprahs font to Times New Roman It has good readibility and legibility throughout the website. I use predominantly white and purple, especially in headings and buttons. They work well as a contrast.
                        I have a relationship between the purple and White in my website. Important Headings and buttons have a white background and purple text colour when selected. But smaller h3 headings have purple backgrounds and white font colours. This is consistent throughout my website.
                        With regards to hierarchy I use size, colour and whitespace to represent important headings and buttons. I use proximity and repetition throughout my website so there is a constant sense of distance and repetition between all of my elements.
                        Lastly, my interface elements use a rounded shape to create a friendly voice and tone to them, inviting the user to read more and navigate easily. But this is balanced by my selection of purple which cteates a more serious tone so that employers may know that although this is an inviting website, I am serious about my work and presenting myself.
                        All headings are placed above paragraph text to pull the eye toward it first. The white background of headings contrast the purple background of my website, highlighting its importance in the hierarchy and again, pulling the users eye toward it first.

                <h2><span>Style Guide</span></h2>
                <p>i. My Website is modern and minimalistic, making it easily traversable.</p>
                <p>ii. The interface elements used in my website are all rounded creating a friendly and inviting tone. Headings all have a white and purple contrast relationship.
                    The contrast bewteen the background and white headings highlights its importance and therefor draws the eye. Lastly I use mainly, size, colour and whitespace for my hierarchy.

                <h2><span>Implementation notes</span></h2>
                <p>a) My folder structure is laid out to sepearate the html and CSS documents and they are all in order of the hierarchy of the actual site. I used appropriate naming conventions for all styling and made sure to not use in-line styling anywhere throughout my site. The coding is modular in that it can be easily upgraded or changed completely.</p>
                <p>b) I have tried my best in using semantic markup and have managed to clearly express my content through different containers, buttons, links and pages. Using Semantic markup makes my webiste optimised for an search engine. If someone were to search "Max Kruger Game Development", a search engline like google would be able to display my site as one of the answers.
                    However, I could definately improve the accessibility of my website by creating more semantic tags to guide, for example, a blind person using an Ereader to navigate my website </p>
                <p>d) Throughout my html pages I do not use a single in-line styling tag in order to create consistent styling throughout my site. The website itself is modular and thrghout my experience of creating it I have had to modify the pages countless times, proving that it is indeed modular and therefor maintainable.</p>
