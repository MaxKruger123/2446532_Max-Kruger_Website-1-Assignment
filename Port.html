                <p>Welcome to my website! I am Max Kruger. I study at The University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. I am currently a full-time student studying Digital Arts. I have a bunch of hobbies and interests all in the field of Gaming and Game Development. Check out some of my work below! I love making games in my free time, both in Game Jams and when I just feel like it. My passion is in FPS games since this is the genre I grew up with and I still love to this day! Games such as Counter Strike, Call Of Duty and Battlefield have always been staples in my play time. One day I decided to try actually recreate some of the system we see in these games and it all of a sudden making games become something I love!</p>

                <p>As I'm sure you know by now I love making games! In 2021 I started my Game Development journey through university. My passion quickly grew past this and so I started working on it in my own time. By 2023 I had a vision to start my own indie game in that year. My inspiration was a favourate Child Hood game called Ratchet and Clank. Check out what I have done so far by clicking on the image below.</p>

                <li><span>E-Sports</span></li>
                <p>I am a super competitive individual and what a better way to get nito the competitive spirit than e-sports. I have been a fan of not only watching e-sports but I played in e-sports teams for years! From Counter strike in 2015 all the way till now I still love the e-sports scene and watch different games every weekend. Mostly Valorant and Counter Strike. Only problem is I'm not good eough at games anyore to compete, but I would still love to take part in the e-sports scene! Check out my UI/UX development skills in the Bloogs page where I speak about the creation of this website!</p>
