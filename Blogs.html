                    <p>Setting Up GitHub: In the first week we were introduced to GitHub Desktop. At first it was a bit confusing since it is a new program we are using but I'm sure as we continue using it throughout the course it will get easier... </p>

                    <p>HTML: Thanks to high school I had already gained experience with html using basic tags to create small websites. At first when I heard we would be using html I was excited!</p>

                    <p>Development of CSS: This week I began my adventure with CSS which at first made a lot of sense to me. However, after attempting the exercises given to us I quickly realized how complex a website that seems so simple could be</p>

                    <li><span>Week 4 Website Development Blog - My First WireFrame</span></li>
                    <p>Experience Developing my site: My first wireframe of my website was quite messy since I wasn't completely sure what was important when creating a website, I hadn't given UX a thought and nor did I think to myself to set a realistic wireframe. By realistic I mean someone creating their first website.</p>
                </button>

                <button class="Week7" onclick="week7Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 7 Development</span></li>
                    <p>This week was a tough one for me because I had to almost completely restart my website. I felt that I didn't have a good wireframe or realistic approach to my website. So I decided to re-do my my initial wireframe and completely change my website to suit it. </p>
