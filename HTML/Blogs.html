                    <p>Setting Up GitHub: In the first week we were introduced to GitHub Desktop. At first it was a bit confusing since it is a new program we are using but I'm sure as we continue using it throughout the course it will get easier... </p>

                    <p>Experience Developing my site: My first wireframe of my website was quite messy since I wasn't completely sure what was important when creating a website, I hadn't given UX a thought and nor did I think to myself to set a realistic wireframe. By realistic I mean someone creating their first website.</p>

                    <p>This week was a tough one for me because I had to almost completely restart my website. I felt that I didn't have a good wireframe or realistic approach to my website. So I decided to re-do my my initial wireframe and completely change my website to suit it. </p>
